1. What is the OSI model?

The correct answer is:

“The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology.”

It is a theoretical framework used to understand and standardize how different networking protocols interact.

It does not depend on specific hardware or software implementations.

2. How is the OSI model organized?

The correct answer is:

“From the lowest to the highest level.”

The OSI model has seven layers, each building on the one below:

Physical – hardware, cables, signals

Data Link – frames, MAC addresses

Network – IP addresses, routing

Transport – TCP/UDP, reliability

Session – sessions, connections

Presentation – data formatting, encryption

Application – user interface, apps

So it goes from Physical (bottom) to Application (top).
